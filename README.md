# Karuna Booking Search

A WordPress plugin for **karunasiargao.com** — a branded availability search that
replaces the Smoobu embed. A compact one-month calendar (live nightly prices,
sold-out nights greyed out) that sends the visitor to:

```
https://bookings.karunasiargao.com/?arrival=YYYY-MM-DD&departure=YYYY-MM-DD&guests=N#rooms
```

## Install

1. Download the latest zip from **[Releases](../../releases)** (or *Code → Download
   ZIP* and rename the folder to `karuna-booking-search`).
2. WP Admin → **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin** → the zip → **Install** →
   **Activate**.
3. Place it:
   - **Search shortcode:** `[karuna_booking_search]` — in Elementor use a
     *Shortcode* element (never a Text / Heading / HTML widget)
   - **Per-room calendar shortcode:** `[karuna_room_calendar room_id="123"]` —
     same rule, use a *Shortcode* element
   - **Widget:** *Appearance → Widgets → Karuna Booking Search*

## Updates

The plugin checks this repo's **[Releases](../../releases)**. When a release has a
higher version than what's installed, WordPress shows the normal **update
available** notice in *Plugins* and updates with one click — no re-upload.
(WordPress checks automatically every ~12h; force it from *Dashboard → Updates →
Check again*.)

Shipping an update = bump the `Version:` header in `karuna-booking-search.php`
and push to `main`. A GitHub Actions workflow
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`) then tags and publishes the matching
`vX.Y.Z` release with a zip automatically — no manual release step needed.

Uses [Plugin Update Checker](https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker)
(bundled in `plugin-update-checker/`). Works token-free while this repo is public.

## Shortcode attributes

| Attribute    | Default                              | Notes                                             |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `base`       | `https://bookings.karunasiargao.com/`| Where the search submits.                          |
| `target`     | `_self`                              | `_blank` opens results in a new tab.               |
| `max_guests` | `16`                                 | Ceiling for Adults + Children in the Guests picker.|
| `prices`     | `on`                                 | `off` hides the per-night prices.                  |
| `layout`     | `stacked`                            | `stacked` = teal card; `inline` = light wide row.  |
| `button`     | `Search`                             | Submit button label.                              |

```
[karuna_booking_search max_guests="4"]                       Skygazer (sleeps 4)
[karuna_booking_search prices="off"]                         calendar without prices
[karuna_booking_search layout="inline" button="Check availability"]   homepage row
```

**Layouts:** `stacked` is the compact teal card for a sidebar (like the Smoobu
widget). `inline` is a full-width white row — Arrival · Departure · Guests ·
button — for a homepage hero on a light background; it wraps to two columns
below 640px.

## Room calendar shortcode

`[karuna_room_calendar]` — a read-only, branded replacement for Smoobu's
embeddable per-apartment calendar iframe (no date picking, no form; just
shows sold-out nights). Place one per room page.

| Attribute | Default                               | Notes                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `room_id` | *(required)*                          | The room's Smoobu apartment ID.           |
| `months`  | `6`                                    | Total months of data fetched; 2 shown at a time, paged with the `›`/`‹` arrows. |
| `base`    | `https://bookings.karunasiargao.com/` | Where the calendar JSON is fetched from.  |

```
[karuna_room_calendar room_id="3492081"]
```

Find a room's Smoobu apartment ID in the Smoobu dashboard, or in this plugin's
existing search results (the booking engine's admin/rooms list uses the same
IDs).

## Backend dependency

The search widget's price calendar reads `GET /api/calendar` on the booking
engine — the lowest-nightly-rate map, as JSON, with an
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header for `karunasiargao.com`. If that endpoint
or flatpickr's CDN is unreachable the widget falls back to plain native date
fields, so it always works.

The room calendar shortcode reads `GET /api/calendar/room/{apartmentId}` —
that room's own sold-out nights, same CORS treatment, no flatpickr dependency
(a plain read-only grid).

Both endpoints live in the booking-engine repo (`bookings.karunasiargao.com`),
origins controlled by `CORS_ORIGINS`.

## No-plugin alternative

`elementor-html-widget.html` is the whole widget as one paste-in block (markup +
`<style>` + `<script>`, flatpickr from cdnjs) for an Elementor **HTML** widget or
a **Custom HTML** block — but it does not self-update.

## Files

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `karuna-booking-search.php` | Plugin bootstrap, shortcodes, widget, update checker. |
| `assets/kbs.css`, `assets/kbs.js` | Search widget styles + logic (`__KBS_API__` swapped for the endpoint URL at runtime). |
| `assets/kbs-room.css`, `assets/kbs-room.js` | Room calendar shortcode styles + logic (`__KBS_API__` swapped the same way). |
| `elementor-html-widget.html` | Standalone paste-in copy of the search widget only — keep in sync with `assets/kbs.*`. No standalone copy of the room calendar; shortcode-only. |
| `plugin-update-checker/` | Bundled updater library (MIT). |

## Styling

Brand tokens: brown `#9D6B2B`, dark teal `#00333D`, sand `#F0EADC`, font
**Trirong**. Override `.kbs-widget` / `.flatpickr-calendar.kbs-fp` in the theme's
Additional CSS.
